# Project Rules

## GPU Instances

Before choosing hardware, launching remote training, changing concurrency, or recommending SkyPilot targets, read `INSTANCES.md`. It is the source of truth for known GPU instances, access commands, child counts, `env_threads`, cleanup, and gotchas. Update it when benchmark or access facts change.

## Stable Retro

- Use PyPI `stable-retro-turbo`; import path remains `stable_retro`.
- Runtime pin source of truth: `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Use `uv sync --frozen`; make overrides explicit in manifests, run descriptions, and W&B tags.
- Native-vector obs may be channel-last `(n_envs, 84, 84, 4)` or channel-first `(n_envs, 4, 84, 84)`. Detect shape; skip `VecTransposeImage` for channel-first; transpose only channel-last.
- Keep version history and benchmark conclusions in `INSTANCES.md` or experiment reports.

## Training Runs

- Keep generated artifacts out of source control; use `runs/`, `logs/`, and `models/`.
- Log to W&B and upload checkpoint/final artifacts unless explicitly opted out.
- Every run needs a specific description via `--run-description` or Modal `run_description`.
- Do not run robust evals inside remote training by default. Evaluate checkpoints out of process; promote by completion rate, then max x-position, then mean reward.
- Default Modal shape unless overridden: `cpu=16.0`, `memory=32768`, `gpu=T4`, `n_envs=32`, `env_threads=0`, `torch_num_threads=0`, `n_steps=512`, `batch_size=256`, `n_epochs=10`.

## Remote Provider Task Retrospective

After remote-provider monitoring, orchestration, benchmarking, or launches, include a short retrospective: avoidable agent-token spend, reproducibility choices worth encoding, and any useful follow-up to ask about.

## Dependencies

Use `uv` for dependency resolution and keep `uv.lock` committed. Preserve Python supply-chain hardening in `pyproject.toml`.
