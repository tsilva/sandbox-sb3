# Archived Experiment Recipes

These machine-readable recipes are retained for older checked-in specs that
still compose reusable training fragments. Prefer new goal-local specs under
`experiments/goals/<game>/<goal>/specs/` for active research changes.

Machine-readable recipes define reusable training ingredients: environment
semantics, PPO hyperparameters, reward shaping, and logging defaults.

Use a first-class `environment` section for the MDP interface the agent acts
within. It should name the provider and `env_id`, then capture
state sampling, action mapping, preprocessing, termination/event semantics, task
conditioning, and reward shaping. `rlab` materializes this section into
`train_config` for the existing runners and records a deterministic
`environment_hash` over the canonicalized environment identity.
Use `preprocessing.obs_resize: [height, width]` for observation resizing and
`preprocessing.obs_crop: [top, right, bottom, left]` for observation cropping;
do not duplicate them as runtime-specific `observation_size` or `hud_crop_top`
fields in `environment`.

Keep optimizer and execution details such as learning rate, rollout length,
`n_envs`, `env_threads`, runtime image, and W&B naming outside `environment`;
those change the training process, not the environment identity.

Goal specs under `experiments/goals/<game>/<goal>/specs/` remain the launchable queue
documents. A YAML spec may use Hydra `defaults` to compose recipe files, set goal-specific
fields such as `environment.state`, `seeds`, and W&B naming, then
use `overrides` for the small delta that defines the candidate.
Queue-ready recipe fragments may also use `env`, `train`, `reward`, and
`logging` sections; `rlab` merges those into the final `train_config` before
validation. Prefer that shape when converting older specs that must preserve the
exact runner-facing payload.

Keep `experiments/goals/<game>/<goal>/_goal.yaml` as the stable goal contract. The
curated pointer to the best training recipe so far belongs in
`experiments/goals/.deprecated/<goal>/best.yml`. Keep `best.yml` small: store the recipe or
spec identity, W&B run ids/names, relevant decision metrics, checkpoint or final
artifact refs, status, and a short decision note. W&B remains the source of
truth for full run history and raw metrics; `best.yml` is only the checked-in
index of the current best recipe and why it matters.

At enqueue time, `rlab train --spec-file <path>.yaml` resolves every Hydra
`defaults` entry, materializes the final `train_config`, validates the existing expanded
train-spec contract, and stores composition source hashes in `spec_payload_json`.
The queue still executes a fully expanded immutable payload.

Queue compatibility is owned by the immutable `runtime_image_ref`; do not add
new `profile` or `run_target` fields to train specs unless an explicit migration
brings those concepts back.
