# SuperMarioBros-NES Level 1 Winning Training Recipe

Last updated: 2026-06-19

This is the current preferred training recipe for `SuperMarioBros-Nes-v0`
`Level1-1` screening on the RTX4090. It is based on the B33 target-KL 0.20
recipe, upgraded to `stable-retro-turbo==1.0.0.post14`, with frame maxpooling
disabled after B40.

## Recipe

```

Use 5 concurrent child trainings on `k8s/rtx4090` for throughput screening.

## Evidence

B40 no-maxpool, `stable-retro-turbo==1.0.0.post14`, seeds `42-46`:

wandb_group: b40-b33-targetkl020-post14-no-maxpool-5parallel-20260619_190307
seed42 yo9p05i3 final 39/100, peak 83/100 at 2,726,112
seed43 ibdjtkba final 65/100, peak 88/100 at 4,442,944

seed46 6ugxz6bs final 100/100, peak 100/100 at 3,881,520
mean_final: 56.8/100
median_final: 56/100
best_final: 100/100
best_peak: 100/100
aggregate_fps: 6429
```

B39 maxpool comparison, same post14 target-KL 0.20 recipe, seeds `37-41`:

```text
wandb_group: b39-b33-targetkl020-post14-5parallel-20260619_171334
mean_final: 70.2/100
median_final: 84/100
best_final: 90/100
best_peak: 93/100
aggregate_fps: 6095
```

Decision: use no-maxpool as part of the active training recipe because it is
faster and produced a strict `100/100` winner. Keep the B39 result in mind:
maxpooling had the better five-seed average, so this recipe is a winning
screening recipe, not yet a statistically confirmed population-level baseline.
