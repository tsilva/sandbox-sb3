# Experiment Recipes

Machine-readable recipes define reusable training ingredients: environment
semantics, PPO hyperparameters, reward shaping, and logging defaults.

Use a first-class `environment` section for the MDP interface the agent acts
within. It should name the provider and provider environment id, then capture
state sampling, action mapping, preprocessing, termination/event semantics, task
conditioning, and reward shaping. `rlab` materializes this section into
`train_config` for the existing runners and records a deterministic
`environment_hash` over the canonicalized environment identity.

Keep optimizer and execution details such as learning rate, rollout length,
`n_envs`, `env_threads`, runtime image, and W&B naming outside `environment`;
those change the training process, not the environment identity.

Goal specs under `experiments/goals/<goal>/specs/` remain the launchable queue
documents. A YAML spec may `extends` one or more recipe files, set goal-specific
fields such as `environment.state`, `seeds`, `run_target`, and W&B naming, then
use `overrides` for the small delta that defines the candidate.

At enqueue time, `rlab train --spec-file <path>.yaml` resolves every `extends`
entry, materializes the final `train_config`, validates the existing expanded
train-spec contract, and stores composition source hashes in `spec_payload_json`.
The queue still executes a fully expanded immutable payload.

Use `profile` only for queue/eval execution lanes such as profile-locked eval
workers. Do not use it as a synonym for hyperparameter recipe; use `recipe`,
`spec`, or `lane` instead.
