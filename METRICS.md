# Metrics Reference

This file describes the metrics this repo currently logs to Weights & Biases from the active
`src/rlab` training and evaluation paths.

Training runs call `wandb.init(..., sync_tensorboard=True)` and define `global_step` as the
step metric for all logged keys. Most scalar metrics are recorded through the SB3 logger and
synced from TensorBoard. A few callbacks also call `wandb_run.log(...)` directly for histograms,
videos, and done-count updates.

## Naming Conventions

Prefer metric paths shaped as `<phase>/<dimension>/<value-family>/<stat>`, keeping names concise
but explicit enough to search by phase, info-value, reward, or progress.

Use `train` and `eval` as the first path segment. Keep aggregate metrics at the phase level, for example
`train/done/all` and `eval/reward/mean`.

Use `rate` for fractions in `[0, 1]`, `count` for point-in-time counts, and standard stat suffixes such as
`mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `abs_mean`, and `nonzero_rate` only where a metric family explicitly logs
distribution statistics. Avoid aliases and alternate names for the same value.

`global_step` is the W&B step axis for training metrics logged directly to W&B and for
TensorBoard-synced SB3 metrics. Out-of-process checkpoint eval logs use checkpoint step as the W&B
step value and also log `eval/checkpoint/step`.

## Selection Metrics

These are the first metrics to check when choosing policies.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `train/done/all` | Cumulative count of non-`global_reset` training `done=True` env-slot episode boundaries. This is exhaustive. |
| `train/done/<reason>` | Cumulative count of done events attributed to `<reason>`, such as `life_loss`, `level_change`, `max_steps`, or `unclassified`. Reason counters are explanatory and do not have to sum to `train/done/all`. |
| `train/done/max_steps` | Cumulative count of terminal training episodes attributed to max-step truncation. Emitted as `0` before the first max-step episode. |
| `train/done/unclassified` | Cumulative count of terminal training episodes that had no configured done reason and were not max-step truncations. Emitted as `0` before the first unclassified episode. |
| `train/done/<reason>/from/<prev>` | Cumulative count of structured done events for `<reason>` whose native payload reported previous value `<prev>`. Multi-key values are joined with `-`, e.g. `0-0`. |
| `train/done/<reason>/from/<prev>/ep_window/rate` | Fraction of the last 100 non-`global_reset` terminal training episodes whose configured source value for `<reason>` was `<prev>` that ended with that structured done event. Each `<reason>/from/<prev>` has its own 100-episode denominator and emits only after that per-source window is full. |
| `train/done/<reason>/from_rate/min` | Minimum across full per-source terminal episode-window rates for `<reason>`. |
| `train/done/<reason>/from_rate/mean` | Mean across full per-source terminal episode-window rates for `<reason>`. |
| `train/info/level_complete` | Root for Mario training level-complete metrics. This is the only `info_events`-derived training metric family. |
| `train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/count` | Cumulative clean level clears from native source value `<prev>`, e.g. `0-0` for Level1-1. Death or life-loss info always records as a failed attempt, even if an upstream completion flag is also present. |
| `train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/rate` | Fraction of the last 100 attempts from `<prev>` that produced a clean `level_complete`. Attempts can end at a clean completion, life loss, truncation, or episode done; death/life-loss attempts contribute `0`. Emits only after that source has a full 100-attempt window. |
| `train/info/level_complete/rate_min/last` | Minimum across the latest available `train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/rate` values. Emits after at least one per-source rate is available and updates whenever any per-source rate updates. |
| `eval/done/level_change/rate` | Pooled eval episode completion fraction. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from/<start>/rate` | Eval completion fraction for episodes that started from `<start>`. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from_rate/min` | Minimum per-start eval completion fraction. Use this first when comparing multi-start-state policies. |

Current training does not log per-rollout done-count distribution stats such as `train/done/min`,
`train/done/mean`, or `train/done/max`. The aggregate all-done counter is `train/done/all`.

### Selection and Redundancy Notes

Training level-complete metrics live under `train/info/level_complete/*` and count attempts, not full
episodes. Use them for live training clear counts/rates when a policy can clear multiple levels
inside one episode. Use `train/done/*` only to understand what is ending training episodes.

`eval/done/level_change/from_rate/min` is the eval selection metric for multi-start-state
policies. The top-level eval metrics are pooled summaries and should be treated as secondary
when per-start-state eval done metrics exist.

### Mario Level1-1/Level1-2 Notes

For the current Level1-1/Level1-2 training goal, native level values map to training metrics as:

| Level | Count metric | Rate metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Level1-1` | `train/info/level_complete/from/0-0/count` | `train/info/level_complete/from/0-0/rate` |
| `Level1-2` | `train/info/level_complete/from/0-1/count` | `train/info/level_complete/from/0-1/rate` |

For active multi-level training, use `train/info/level_complete/rate_min/last` as the live
bottleneck. It is the minimum of the most recent full-window per-level rates that have emitted so
far. For example, if Level1-1 is `0.50` and Level1-2 is `0.30`, `rate_min/last` is `0.30`. If
Level1-1 later drops from `1.00` to `0.50` while Level1-2 drops from `0.60` to `0.55`, `rate_min/last`
is `0.50`. Training intentionally no longer logs generic `train/event/*`, `train/outcome/*`, or
aggregate training mean clear-rate metrics. Once checkpoint eval jobs have logged per-start metrics,
use `eval/done/level_change/from_rate/min` as the balanced eval selection metric.

`train/done/level_change/from_rate/min` and `train/done/level_change/from_rate/mean` are terminal
episode-window diagnostics. Keep them as done-reason diagnostics; for clear counts/rates, prefer
`train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/count` and `train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/rate`
because they also count non-terminal clears and exclude death or life-loss transitions. For a
single training selection scalar across source levels, prefer
`train/info/level_complete/rate_min/last`.

Use current `train/reward_share/*` metrics for reward attribution rather than the older
`train/reward_component/*` namespace. Shares are based on absolute rollout contribution
magnitude, so negative components such as death or time penalties are visible by magnitude
rather than canceling against positive reward.

Training info events are configured with `--info-events-json`, which maps event names to native
info-variable rules. `--done-on-events` separately chooses which configured events terminate an
episode. Legacy `--done-on-info-json` remains supported as shorthand for "observe these events and
terminate on all of them." For Mario, a typical observed event set is
`{"life_loss":["lives","decrease"],"level_change":[["levelHi","levelLo"],"change"]}`. Native/default
environment terminations that do not match a configured rule and are not max-step truncations count
as `train/done/unclassified`. When native `done_on_info` payloads include `prev` and `next`,
training also emits fully softcoded previous-value counters such as
`train/done/level_change/from/0-0`. For per-source episode-window rates, successful structured
events use the native payload `prev`; terminal episodes where that reason did not fire use the
configured rule keys read from terminal `info` as the source value. For Mario
`level_change`, that means life-loss or max-step terminal episodes still count in the denominator
for their current `(levelHi, levelLo)` source level. Training intentionally does not emit `to` or
full-transition counters because those multiply metric cardinality quickly. Training does not emit
initializer-state mirrors under `train/state/<initializer>/done/*`; those labels are not reliable
for natural level transitions. Evaluation forces `done_on_info={}` in env construction but stops
the eval episode when it observes completion, so `eval/done/level_change` and
`eval/done/level_change/from/<start>` track natural transitions per eval episode. Eval `from` values
are the configured episode start state, not native `done_on_info` previous-value payloads.

`train/done/*` windows remain terminal-episode metrics. Natural clean clears observed while the
training env keeps running set `level_complete` / `completion_event`, increment
`train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/count`, and append to that source's
`train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/rate` attempt window. This is the metric family to use when
the question is "did the policy clear this level?"

To sniff whether training is terminating on specific Mario events, chart the terminal counters
rather than the clean-clear counters:

- `train/done/life_loss` increasing means life-loss events are ending training episodes.
- `train/done/level_change` increasing means level-change events are ending training episodes.
- `train/done/all` is the exhaustive terminal episode count. Reason counters are explanatory, so
  `train/done/life_loss + train/done/level_change` can exceed `train/done/all` when the same terminal
  info payload reports both events.
- `train/info/level_complete/from/<prev>/count` should be less than or equal to
  `train/done/level_change/from/<prev>` when level changes are terminal. Any excess
  `train/done/level_change/from/<prev>` over clean `level_complete` count is terminal level-change
  traffic that was not accepted as a clean clear, for example a life-loss/death transition.

`level_change` is the generic stable-retro-style info event: it means configured native level
variables changed. The Mario target wrapper is responsible for deciding whether that raw transition
was actually a level clear. It sets the per-step `completion_event` / `level_complete` flag only
when the level changed without a detected death or life loss. The metrics callback then reuses the
raw `level_change` payload's `prev` value as the source, so a clean transition from `(0, 0)` to
`(0, 1)` records `train/info/level_complete/from/0-0/count`. `completion_event` is an info flag/alias
consumed by code; `level_complete` is the semantic event/result name used in W&B metrics. As a
defensive guard, the metrics callback treats any attempt with `died`, `life_loss`, or a `life_loss`
info event as failed even if a contradictory completion flag appears in the same info payload.

## SB3 PPO Metrics

These come from Stable-Baselines3 PPO and `VecMonitor`.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rollout/ep_rew_mean` | Mean shaped episode return over SB3's monitor window. This is the reward used by training, not raw game score. |
| `rollout/ep_len_mean` | Mean episode length over SB3's monitor window. |
| `time/fps` | Cumulative SB3 training throughput in environment steps per second. |
| `time/iterations` | Number of PPO learn iterations completed. |
| `time/time_elapsed` | Wall-clock seconds elapsed in the SB3 learn loop. |
| `time/total_timesteps` | Total environment steps reached by SB3 or the in-loop eval callback. |
| `train/approx_kl` | Approximate KL divergence between old and updated policies for the last PPO update. Spikes indicate large policy updates. |
| `train/clip_fraction` | Fraction of policy updates clipped by PPO's ratio clipping. High values mean many updates hit the trust-region bound. |
| `train/clip_range` | Active PPO policy clip range. |
| `train/clip_range_vf` | Active value-function clip range. Logged only when value clipping is configured. |
| `train/entropy_loss` | Negative entropy term from PPO. More negative generally means higher action entropy. |
| `train/explained_variance` | How much return variance the value function explains. Near 1 is good; near 0 or negative means weak value prediction. |
| `train/learning_rate` | Active optimizer learning rate after any schedule. |
| `train/loss` | Combined PPO loss for the last update. |
| `train/n_updates` | Cumulative optimizer update count. |
| `train/policy_gradient_loss` | PPO policy-gradient loss component. |
| `train/std` | Mean learned action-distribution standard deviation, logged by SB3 only for policies with `log_std`. Usually absent for discrete-action Mario policies. |
| `train/value_loss` | PPO value-function loss component. |

## Throughput Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `throughput/rollout_fps` | Rollout-only environment-step throughput, measured from rollout start to rollout end. This excludes PPO optimization time. |
| `throughput/loop_fps` | Full-loop instantaneous throughput, measured from one rollout start to the next. This includes rollout collection plus PPO optimization overhead. |

## Artifact Timing Metrics

These sparse metrics are logged when training logs model artifacts. Checkpoint rows use the checkpoint
step as `global_step`; final and best artifacts use the model's current timestep.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `train/artifact/stall_seconds` | Wall-clock time spent in the synchronous artifact boundary. For checkpoints this spans local checkpoint save plus artifact metadata/upload/logging; for final artifacts this spans final model save plus artifact metadata/upload/logging; for best artifacts this spans artifact metadata/upload/logging only. |
| `train/artifact/local_save_seconds` | Local SB3 checkpoint or final model save duration. Logged when the local save can be paired with the artifact log. |
| `train/artifact/log_seconds` | Total wall-clock time spent inside artifact metadata/upload/logging after the model zip already exists. |
| `train/artifact/metadata_seconds` | Time spent writing the checkpoint metadata sidecar. |
| `train/artifact/storage_upload_seconds` | Time spent uploading the model zip to external S3/R2 storage before W&B receives a reference artifact. Zero when no external artifact storage URI is configured. |
| `train/artifact/wandb_log_seconds` | Time spent in `wandb_run.log_artifact(...)`. With reference artifacts this mostly covers W&B metadata/reference logging; without reference artifacts it can include uploading the model zip to W&B. |

## Rollout Diagnostics

Logged at rollout end from the SB3 rollout buffer.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rollout/value_pred/mean` | Mean value-function prediction over the collected rollout buffer. |
| `rollout/value_pred/std` | Standard deviation of value predictions. |
| `rollout/value_pred/min` | Minimum value prediction. |
| `rollout/value_pred/max` | Maximum value prediction. |
| `rollout/value_pred/abs_mean` | Mean absolute value prediction. |
| `rollout/value_pred/hist` | W&B histogram of rollout-buffer value predictions. Logged directly to W&B. |
| `rollout/advantage/mean` | Mean computed advantage over the collected rollout buffer. |
| `rollout/advantage/std` | Standard deviation of computed advantages. |
| `rollout/advantage/min` | Minimum computed advantage. |
| `rollout/advantage/max` | Maximum computed advantage. |
| `rollout/advantage/abs_mean` | Mean absolute computed advantage. |
| `rollout/advantage/hist` | W&B histogram of rollout-buffer advantages. Logged directly to W&B. |

For `value_pred` and `advantage`, `mean` preserves sign and can cancel positive and negative
entries, while `abs_mean` removes sign before averaging and tracks typical magnitude. For example,
predictions `[-10, 10]` have `mean = 0` but `abs_mean = 10`. Use `rollout/value_pred/mean` to
see value-function bias or drift in one direction, and `rollout/value_pred/abs_mean` to see whether
the critic's predicted returns are large regardless of sign.

## Reward Component Diagnostics

Logged at rollout end from reward fields in env `info` dictionaries.

`train/reward/<component>/<stat>` is logged for each component that appears during the rollout.

Components:

| Component | Source field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shaped` | `shaped_reward` | Final shaped reward passed toward training. |
| `raw` | `raw_reward` | Raw environment reward before repo reward shaping. |
| `native` | `native_reward_component` | Native stable-retro reward component. |
| `prog` | `progress_component` | Generic progress component, when supplied by the env wrapper. |
| `prog_x` | `progress_reward_component` | X-position progress reward component. |
| `score` | `score_reward_component` | Score-derived reward component. |
| `score_d` | `score_delta` | Raw score delta observed in the step. |
| `done` | `completion_reward_component` | Completion bonus component. |

| `train/reward/<component>/min` | Minimum component value. |
| `train/reward/<component>/max` | Maximum component value. |
| `train/reward/<component>/abs_mean` | Mean absolute component value. |
| `train/reward/<component>/nonzero_rate` | Fraction of collected values where the component was nonzero. |

Reward share metrics compare absolute component magnitudes within a rollout.
`train/reward_share/<component>` is logged for each share component:

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `train/reward_share/prog_x` | Share of absolute reward-component mass from X-progress reward. |
| `train/reward_share/score` | Share from score reward. |
| `train/reward_share/death` | Share from death penalties. |
| `train/reward_share/done` | Share from completion bonuses. |
| `train/reward_share/time` | Share from time penalties. |
| `train/reward_share/native` | Share from native stable-retro reward. |

## Optional Training Metrics

| Metric | Logged when | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `train/ent_coef` | `--ent-coef-final` is set | Active entropy coefficient from the entropy coefficient schedule. |
| `train/adv_norm/mode` | `--advantage-normalization per-task` | Marker value `1.0`, meaning per-task advantage normalization is active. |
| `train/adv/task<id>/count` | Per-task advantage normalization | Number of rollout-buffer samples assigned to task `<id>`. |
| `train/adv/task<id>/mean_pre` | Per-task advantage normalization | Mean task advantage before normalization. |
| `train/adv/task<id>/std_pre` | Per-task advantage normalization | Standard deviation before normalization. |
| `train/adv/task<id>/mean_post` | Per-task advantage normalization | Mean task advantage after normalization. |
| `train/adv/task<id>/std_post` | Per-task advantage normalization | Standard deviation after normalization. |

## Evaluation Metrics

These are logged by the in-training `RetroEvalCallback` when training-loop eval is enabled, and
by `rlab-eval` artifact mode when evaluating checkpoint artifacts out of process.
Evaluation env construction forces `done_on_info={}`.

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `eval/reward/mean` | Mean eval episode return. |
| `eval/reward/std` | Standard deviation of eval episode returns. |
| `eval/reward/max` | Maximum eval episode return. |
| `eval/progress/x/mean` | Mean max global X position reached per eval episode. |
| `eval/progress/x/max` | Maximum global X position reached by any eval episode. |
| `eval/progress/level_x/mean` | Mean max level-local X position reached per eval episode. |
| `eval/progress/level_x/max` | Maximum level-local X position reached by any eval episode. |
| `eval/done/all` | Number of eval episodes summarized. This is exhaustive. |
| `eval/done/level_change` | Eval episodes that completed by natural level transition. |
| `eval/done/level_change/rate` | `eval/done/level_change / eval/done/all`. |
| `eval/done/max_steps` | Eval episodes that hit the max-step limit. |
| `eval/done/max_steps/rate` | `eval/done/max_steps / eval/done/all`. |
| `eval/done/unclassified` | Eval episodes that ended without level completion or max-step truncation. |
| `eval/done/unclassified/rate` | `eval/done/unclassified / eval/done/all`. |
| `eval/death/count` | Eval episodes where the final info indicated death. |
| `eval/death/rate` | `eval/death/count / eval episodes`. |
| `eval/death/x_hist` | W&B histogram of death X positions. Logged when death positions exist. |
| `eval/best/reward` | Return of the best eval episode, ranked by completion first, then max X, then reward. |
| `eval/best/x` | Max global X position of the best eval episode. |
| `eval/best/video` | W&B video for the best eval episode, when video recording is enabled. |
| `eval/checkpoint/step` | Checkpoint step being evaluated. Logged by `rlab-eval` artifact mode. |
| `eval/checkpoint/artifact` | W&B checkpoint artifact name being evaluated. Logged by `rlab-eval` artifact mode. |
| `eval/config/hud_crop_top` | HUD crop used for the out-of-process checkpoint eval. |

Per-start-state eval done metrics mirror the training done namespace as
`eval/done/<reason>/from/<start>`. Because eval disables `done_on_info`, `<start>` is the eval
episode start state, for example `Level1-1`, rather than a native previous-value tuple such as
`0-0`.

| Metric template | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `eval/done/all/from/<start>` | Number of eval episodes that started from `<start>`. This is the denominator for that start state. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from/<start>` | Eval episodes from `<start>` that completed by natural level transition. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from/<start>/rate` | `eval/done/level_change/from/<start> / eval/done/all/from/<start>`. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from_rate/min` | Minimum per-start-state level-change rate. Use this for balanced multi-state eval ranking. |
| `eval/done/level_change/from_rate/mean` | Mean per-start-state level-change rate. |
| `eval/done/max_steps/from/<start>` | Eval episodes from `<start>` that hit the max-step limit. |
| `eval/done/max_steps/from/<start>/rate` | `eval/done/max_steps/from/<start> / eval/done/all/from/<start>`. |
| `eval/done/unclassified/from/<start>` | Eval episodes from `<start>` that ended without level completion or max-step truncation. |
| `eval/done/unclassified/from/<start>/rate` | `eval/done/unclassified/from/<start> / eval/done/all/from/<start>`. |

## Eval JSON Summary Fields

`rlab-eval` and in-training eval write richer JSON summaries to local files. These fields are
stored in eval history or stdout JSON; only the `eval/*` subset above is logged to W&B by default.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `episodes` | Number of eval episodes summarized. |
| `deterministic` | Whether eval used deterministic policy actions. |
| `reward_mean` | Mean eval episode return before mapping to `eval/reward/mean`. |

| `max_x_max` | Maximum global X position before mapping to `eval/progress/x/max`. |
| `max_level_x_mean` | Mean max level-local X position before mapping to `eval/progress/level_x/mean`. |
| `max_level_x_max` | Maximum level-local X position before mapping to `eval/progress/level_x/max`. |
| `completion_count` | Eval episodes that completed by natural level transition. Same count as `eval/done/level_change`. |
| `completion_rate` | `completion_count / episodes`. Same rate as `eval/done/level_change/rate`. |
| `death_count` | Eval episodes whose final info indicated death. Same count as `eval/death/count`. |
| `death_rate` | `death_count / episodes`. Same rate as `eval/death/rate`. |
| `terminated_count` | Eval episodes that terminated without being marked as max-step truncations. |
| `terminated_rate` | `terminated_count / episodes`. |
| `truncated_count` | Eval episodes that hit the max-step limit. Same count as `eval/done/max_steps`. |
| `truncated_rate` | `truncated_count / episodes`. Same rate as `eval/done/max_steps/rate`. |
| `unclassified_count` | Eval episodes that ended without level completion or max-step truncation. Same count as `eval/done/unclassified`. |
| `unclassified_rate` | `unclassified_count / episodes`. Same rate as `eval/done/unclassified/rate`. |
| `death_x_histogram` | Local JSON histogram of death X positions. W&B receives `eval/death/x_hist` when death positions exist. |
| `episode_results` | Per-episode records used to build the summary. Removed from stdout when `--summary-only` is set. |
| `best_episode` | Best episode record ranked by completion first, then max X, then reward. |
| `best_model_score` | In-training eval ranking tuple: completion metric, max X, reward mean. |
| `best_episode_video` | Local best-episode video path when video recording is enabled. W&B receives `eval/best/video`. |
| `timesteps` | Training timestep attached by in-training eval summaries. |
| `eval_n_envs` | Number of vector env slots used by artifact/local eval summaries. |
| `checkpoint_step` | Checkpoint step attached by artifact eval summaries. W&B receives `eval/checkpoint/step`. |
| `checkpoint_artifact` | Checkpoint artifact name attached by artifact eval summaries. W&B receives `eval/checkpoint/artifact`. |
| `model` | Local model path used by local or artifact eval summaries. |
| `policy` | Scripted policy name for scripted eval, or `ppo` for model eval. |
| `hud_crop_top` | HUD crop used for eval. W&B receives `eval/config/hud_crop_top` in artifact eval. |
| `eval_seed` | Seed used for a specific artifact checkpoint eval. |

## W&B Config And Artifacts

The run config is not a metric, but W&B stores all train CLI args plus resolved environment
configuration fields such as `game`, `state`, `states`, `state_probs`, `task_conditioning`,
frame skip, action set, reward settings, termination settings, preprocessing settings, and
state-distribution metadata.

Training logs model artifacts when W&B artifacts are enabled:

| Artifact kind | When logged | Contents and metadata |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<run>-checkpoint` | New checkpoint zip files under the run checkpoint directory | Model zip plus metadata sidecar. Aliases include `latest` and `step-<step>` when the step can be parsed. |
| `<run>-best` | In-training best model or out-of-process promoted best checkpoint | Model zip plus metadata. Aliases include `best`, `latest`, and sometimes `step-<step>`. |
| `<run>-final` | End of training | Final model zip plus metadata. Aliases include `final` and `latest`. |

When `--wandb-artifact-storage-uri`, `WANDB_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_URI`, or `CHECKPOINT_BUCKET_URI`
is set, the model zip is uploaded to S3/R2 and W&B stores a reference artifact instead of the
bulk model bytes.
